<h1>Welcome to my website.</h1>
<h2>About me</h2>

<p style="width:400px">Music is a big interest, it's very important to me.
       I have two cats, they are 10 and 8 years.
       I like to play videogames, read books and watch movies. 
       I've got a passion for writing lyrics and poems, i've been 
       writing my own since i was 13 or 14 years old. 
       Writing is very therapeutic for me.

       <div style="width:400px">I like to paint, though i rarely do it at the moment and 
       i wouldn't say i'm good at it, i just do it for fun and because
       it can be therapeutic as well.</div>
